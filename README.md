# CSAW '23 Qualifiers Writeups

I am really glad to have had the opportunity to participate in the CSAW CTF competition for 2023 as a part of the [49th Security Division](https://49sd.com/) from September 15th to 17th, 2023!

Our team earned 2834 points, placing us at 103rd place out of the nearly 1,500 teams that competed.

I completed 6 challenges, earning 1608 points for my team, although I may or may not have ended up getting no sleep at all this weekend in the process...

And here are some writeups for the challenges I completed in this competition!

The points for the challenges were not predetermined, but determined by the number of people who solved them. The maximum points for a challenge was 500, but this decreased as more people solved the challenges.

Overall, I had a lot of fun with this competition and definitely can't wait to hopefully participate next year too!

# Intro: whataxor

**Points:** 75

**Author:** ElykDeer

**Description:** Now you actually need to figure what the binary is doing.......maybe try a tool like https://dogbolt.org/; It shows you the output of several tools that try to extract a representation similar to what the original code might have looked like.....which is a lot nicer than reading bytes.

**Files:** [readme.txt](files/whataxor/readme[1].txt), [whataxor](files/whataxor/whataxor[1])
